## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

first I learn how to upload a project like this in github , then I learnd flex box to do this project

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
